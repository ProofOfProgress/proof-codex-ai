# proof-codex-ai

This repository powers the Proof Codex AI: an autonomous system designed to generate, enforce, and evolve the operational laws, systems, and protocols behind the Proof of Progress brand.

The AI integrates Codex playbooks, viewer psychology data, and editing mandates to scale Proof Army content with maximum precision and no filler.

## Key guides
- `Proof_AI_Advisor_Protocol.txt` — governs AI advisory logic
- `Proof_Codex_3.0_Full_Master_Playbook.txt` — master operational ruleset

## Mission
Drive visible growth, suffering, and community loyalty through AI-executed Codex laws.

## Status
This AI continuously evolves via task logs, commits, and Codex updates.
